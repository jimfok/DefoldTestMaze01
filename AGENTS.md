# AGENTS.md
- Codex should modify only Lua / script / *.md / *.png files (e.g. *.script, *.gui_script, *.render_script).
- Any tasks related to Defold collections, GUIs, or game objects should be escalated to a human.
- Update codexlog.md whenever Codex makes a change, grouping all modifications made on the same day under a single section.
